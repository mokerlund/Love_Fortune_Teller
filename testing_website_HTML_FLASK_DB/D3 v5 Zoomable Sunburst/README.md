Ported from [this Observable notebook](https://beta.observablehq.com/@tasqon/d3-circle-packing) for [this](https://talk.observablehq.com/t/notebook-to-vanilla-javascript-steps/1644/5) forum thread. Many thanks to Bryan Gingechen who answered my question about the necessary steps to get from an (Observable) JavaScript notebook to a vanilla JavaScript index.html. He presented his solution on [blockbuilder.org](https://blockbuilder.org/bryangingechen/ffd619bb5889d146fe6c5d581d3ea00e)
